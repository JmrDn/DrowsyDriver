        \t Drivers are most likely to experience drowsiness due to the hours of driving,
        stress, and even workplace issues. The Driver Drowsiness Detection System (DDDS)
        is a tool dedicated especially for drivers who experience drowsiness during working
        hours in the working environment. This device will aid the road traffic accidents caused
        by drowsiness of the driver during working hours and within the working environment.
        With the help of this IoT integrated system, this will allow drivers to avoid road traffic
        accidents because of that it reduces the amount of road traffic accidents that happen every year.
